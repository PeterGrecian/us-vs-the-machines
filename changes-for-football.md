This is an excellent application for your project's current architecture. The file structure and class design you've established are well-suited to handle EPL football predictions and results. You can easily adapt your existing classes to this new domain.

### Adapting Your Classes

You don't need to create entirely new classes; you can simply rename and modify the existing ones to fit the new context.

  * `RaceEvent` can become `Matchday`. This class will hold the description of the match day (e.g., "EPL Matchday 15").
  * `PredictedRaceStandings` can become `PredictedMatchdayResults`. It will store the predictions for a single match day.
  * `ActualRaceResults` can become `ActualMatchdayResults`. It will hold the official results for a single match day.
  * `PredictionAnalysis` will remain the same, but its internal logic will change to calculate new metrics.

### New Data Structure

Your `drivers_and_positions` dictionary will need to be changed to store football matches and their scores. A good way to do this is to use a nested dictionary where the keys are the matches and the values are the scores.

**Example for predicted data:**

```python
predictions = {
    "Arsenal vs Chelsea": {"home_score": 2, "away_score": 1},
    "Man City vs Liverpool": {"home_score": 3, "away_score": 3}
}
```

### New Metrics for Analysis

The metrics you use to measure correctness will need to change from ranking-based to outcome-based.

  * **Outcome Accuracy:** This is a simple measure of how many matches you correctly predicted the outcome of (Win, Lose, or Draw). It's a key metric for football predictions.
  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on Scores:** This is a great way to measure how close your predicted scores were to the actual scores. You would calculate the sum of the absolute differences for each score, then divide by the total number of matches.
  * **Points-Based Scoring:** You can create your own custom scoring system, for example:
      * 3 points for a correct score prediction (e.g., predicted 2-1, actual 2-1).
      * 1 point for a correct outcome prediction but incorrect score (e.g., predicted 2-1, actual 3-2).
